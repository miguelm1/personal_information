Hi, I’m Miguel Moreno Manrique

Telecommunications Engineer & AI Developer specialized in automating telco operations and transforming network data into actionable intelligence.
Currently working as Telco Development Engineer – AI & Automation at Onivia, where I build end-to-end AI/ML solutions that enhance network reliability, optimize workflows, and empower engineering teams.

I love converting complex FTTH infrastructure problems into clean, scalable, data-driven tools — from automating documentation pipelines to deploying models that predict, classify or prioritize incidents.

What I’m Working On
-  Designing and deploying AI/ML use cases for telco ops (incident prediction, quality scoring, anomaly detection).
-  Building dashboards and digital assistants that simplify data access and improve decision-making.
-  Creating ETLs, APIs, and SQL-driven pipelines to guarantee data quality and scalability.
-  Sharing knowledge with engineering teams through best practices, documentation, and internal tooling.

Background
-  MSc in Artificial Intelligence (UNIR, 2025)
     Specializations: NLP · Computer Vision · Deep Learning
-  Telecommunications Engineer with 7+ years of experience in FTTH deployments:
-  Network design, auditing, and KPIs for national operators (MásMóvil, Lyntia, Avatel, CityNet).
-  Contractor coordination, cost control, and data quality initiatives.
-  Development of automation tools for network documentation and certification.
